1. Open the input file "how_to_1/worldpop.txt".
2. Check if the file is successfully opened; if not, print an error message and exit with an error code.

3. Initialize variables:
   - totalPopulation to 0
   - line as an empty string
   - countryName as an empty string
   - isEuropeanUnion as false

4. Loop through each line in the input file:
   a. Read a line from the file and store it in the variable "line".
   b. Reset the variables: countryName to an empty string and isEuropeanUnion to false.

   c. Loop through each character (c) in the line:
      - If c is not a whitespace character:
          i. If isEuropeanUnion is true:
                 - Continue to the next iteration (skip characters after "European Union").
          ii. Add c to the countryName.

      - If c is a whitespace character:
          i. Peek at the next non-whitespace character without extracting it.
          ii. If the next character is a digit:
                  - Read the number (population) from the file and add it to totalPopulation.
                  - Break out of the loop.
              iii. If the next character is not a digit:
                  - Add a space and the next non-whitespace character to countryName.
                  - Read the next non-whitespace character.
                  - Add it to countryName.
                  - If countryName is "European Union":
                        - Set isEuropeanUnion to true.
                        - Break out of the loop.

5. Close the input file.

6. Print the totalPopulation (excluding European Union) to the standard output.

7. Exit the program with a success code (0).
