1. Function createPlayfairMatrix(keyword):
    a. Initialize a 5x5 matrix with empty spaces.
    b. Create a key string by concatenating the keyword and the remaining alphabet without 'J'.
    c. Remove duplicate characters and spaces from the key string.
    d. Sort the key string.
    e. Fill the matrix with characters from the key string.

2. Function findLetterCoordinates(matrix, letter):
    a. Loop through each row and column in the matrix.
    b. If the matrix element at the current position is equal to the given letter, return the row and column coordinates.
    c. If the letter is not found, return (-1, -1).

3. Function playfairEncryptDecryptPair(matrix, a, b, decrypt = false):
    a. Find the coordinates of letters 'a' and 'b' in the matrix using the findLetterCoordinates function.
    b. If 'a' and 'b' are in the same row, replace them with the characters to their left or right based on encryption or decryption.
    c. If 'a' and 'b' are in the same column, replace them with the characters above or below based on encryption or decryption.
    d. If 'a' and 'b' form a rectangle, replace them with the characters at the opposite corners of the rectangle.
    e. Return the result as a string.

4. Function playfairCipher(input, keyword, decrypt = false):
    a. Create the Playfair matrix using the createPlayfairMatrix function.
    b. Initialize an empty string called "result."
    c. Loop through the input string in pairs of two characters:
        i. Extract characters 'a' and 'b' from the input.
        ii. Use the playfairEncryptDecryptPair function to encrypt or decrypt the pair.
        iii. Append the result to the "result" string.
    d. Return the final "result" string.

5. In the main function:
    a. Initialize inputText to "HELLO" and keyword to "PLAYFAIR."
    b. Encrypt the inputText using playfairCipher and print the result.
    c. Decrypt the encrypted text using playfairCipher with decrypt set to true and print the result.

6. End of program.
